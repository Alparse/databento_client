## Build Performance

### Overall Build Metrics
- **Total Projects:** 20 (7 source projects + 12 example projects + 1 interop project)
- **Build Time:** 7.34 seconds
- **Configuration:** Release mode with optimizations
- **Errors:** 0
- **Warnings:** 174 (all XML documentation related, non-critical)

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Timestamp Decoding Issue ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Location:** DbnFileReader.Example, SymbolMap.Example
**Symptom:** Timestamps display as "1/1/1970 12:00:00 AM" (Unix epoch)
**Expected:** Actual trade timestamps (e.g., "2024-01-02 12:00:08")
**Impact:** Timestamp data appears corrupted or not decoded properly
**Files Affected:**
- All Record timestamp fields
- Examples using `record.Timestamp.DateTime`

**Recommendation:**
- Investigate Record.Timestamp property implementation
- Verify native DBN timestamp decoding
- Check if ts_event field is being read correctly (should be nanoseconds since Unix epoch)

### 2. Price Display Issue ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Location:** DbnFileReader.Example
**Symptom:** Prices display as $5,641,124,869.62 instead of expected ~$490
**Expected:** Normal stock prices (NVDA ~$490 in January 2024)
**Impact:** Price data appears corrupted or scaling is incorrect
**Files Affected:**
- Record price fields
- PriceDecimal property

**Recommendation:**
- Verify PriceDecimal conversion from fixed-point int64
- Check price scaling factor (should divide by 1e9)
- Validate against HistoricalData.Example which shows correct prices ($490.05)

**Note:** HistoricalData.Example shows CORRECT prices ($490.05, $490.01, $490.23), so the issue may be specific to DbnFileStore/file reading path, not the general Record handling.

### 3. Console Input Issue ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**

**Location:** HistoricalData.Example
**Symptom:** Exit code 127, Console.ReadKey() exception in non-interactive environment
**Impact:** Example crashes at exit (but after all functionality works)
**Recommendation:** Remove Console.ReadKey() or wrap in try-catch for non-interactive environments

---

## Coverage Gaps

### 1. Live Market Data Processing ⚠️
**Gap:** Cannot verify actual market data handling during closed market hours
**Risk:** Low (infrastructure validated, only data processing unverified)
**Mitigation:** Retest during market hours OR use historical streaming as proxy

### 2. Large File Processing
**Gap:** Only tested with small files (218 bytes)
**Risk:** Low (streaming architecture should handle large files)
**Recommendation:** Test with multi-GB DBN files to verify memory efficiency

### 3. Error Recovery
**Gap:** Limited testing of network failures, retries, reconnection logic
**Risk:** Medium (production apps need robust error recovery)
**Recommendation:** Add integration tests for connection failures

### 4. Concurrent Usage
**Gap:** No multi-threaded testing
**Risk:** Low (client marked as thread-safe)
**Recommendation:** Add stress tests with concurrent API calls

### 5. Cross-Platform Testing
**Gap:** Only tested on Windows
**Risk:** Medium (native library must work on Linux/macOS)
**Recommendation:** Test on Linux and macOS to verify native library loading

---

## Comparison to C++ API

### API Parity ✅
The C# wrapper provides **excellent API coverage** of the C++ databento library:

| Feature | C++ | C# | Notes |
|---------|-----|----|----|
| Historical Client | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity |
| Live Client | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity |
| Metadata Queries | ✅ | ✅ | All 11 methods |
| Symbology Resolution | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity |
| DBN File Reading | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity |
| Symbol Mapping | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity + convenience overloads |
| Batch Downloads | ✅ | ✅ | Full parity |
| Record Types | ✅ | ✅ | All 32+ record types |
| Price Formatting | `Px` | `PriceDecimal` | .NET decimal property |
| Type Casting | `Get<T>()` | `is T` | C# pattern matching |
| Callbacks | `KeepGoing` | `bool` | .NET convention |
| Logging | `ILogReceiver` | `ILogger` | Microsoft.Extensions.Logging |

### Design Improvements Over C++ ✅
1. **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** instead of custom ILogReceiver (better ecosystem integration)
2. **Pattern matching** instead of template Get<T>() (more C# idiomatic)
3. **Convenience overloads** for Record objects (tsMap.At(record), pitMap.Find(record))
4. **Builder pattern** for client creation (more discoverable)
5. **Async/await** throughout (better async story than C++)
